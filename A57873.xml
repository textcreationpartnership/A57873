            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>For, firſt, Chriſt ſuffers theſe Tares, not involuntarily or againſt his will, which would argue either ignorance or impotency, and want of power; but in a voluntary and willing manner: concurring as an univerſal cauſe to the ſuſtentation of the creature; to the natural being of their ſinful actions, though not to the moral defect and ſinfulneſs. And yet ordering their ſins to his own ends, the manifeſtation of his glory, both of his Juſtice and Mercy, by his over-ruling and all-diſpoſing provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though Chriſt ſuffers, yet he only ſuffers the children of the wicked; he doth not inwardly excite and move them unto ſin; not outwardly preſcribe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it in his word; not operatively effect or work; nor approve and allow it being once committed. All which are ſo many arguments of the holineſs of his nature, and the exquiſiteneſs of his Juſtice. Chriſt ſuffers the Tares willingly, and therein gives teſtimony to his Providence; but he only ſuffers, he is not the Author, that ſhews his Juſtice.</p>

Neither need we make ſearch for any other reaſon of Gods proceedings than the ſhort and modeſt anſwer of the School.

And if there be any Tare of wickedneſs that peſters the field of the Lord, ſpreads the roots far and near, advances the head higher, and grows more rank and rife than the reſt; be it <hi>groſſe idolatry, cuſtomary ſwearing, prodigious blaſphemie, open profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath, the filthineſs of whoredom,</hi> or any other; theſe are the Tares which they principally endeavour with all their might, not only to top or crop (as the Heathen King ſtroke off the tops of the Poppies) but pluck them up by th roots. What though they meet with difficulties and diſcouragements of all ſorts and reap no other <hi>guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> of aſſiduity, and faithfulneſs in their calling, but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49040:23"/>enmity and oppoſition: yet muſt they <hi>make their face hard againſt their faces, and their forehead hard againſt their foreheads: Cry aloud and ſpare not, lift up their voice like a Trumpet.

If they preach in the Name of the Lord againſt the crying abominations of the time, they are affronted in the ſame manner with cuſtomary and common practices; So that one way or other the cuſtome is always too hard for us.</hi> And though it be a matter of as great difficulty and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hopes to cry down the cuſtomes of ſin, as of Tythes and payments in the vulgar, being armed and fenced with preſcription in both; Yet this muſt not daunt or damp our ſpirits, nor quell or quail our courage, no more then it diſmayed the Heroical reſolution of ſtout-ſpirited <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> much leſs muſt it move us to grow feeble and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, and utterly to deſiſt with diſconſolate <hi>Jeremiah: Then I ſaid I will not make mention of him nor ſpeak any more in his name,</hi> Jer. 20.9. But notwithſtanding the ſtrength of cuſtome, the publick Miniſter muſt do his beſt to weed out theſe Tares of wickedneſs by the religious miniſtration of the Word and Sacraments.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This was the peculiar priviledge and preheminence of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49040:28"/>Saint <hi>John</hi> that he was an Evangeliſt, Prophet, and Apoſtle; An <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> in the penning of his Goſpel. A <hi>Prophet</hi> in his revelation. A. <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtles.</hi> A Divine <hi>Triſmegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> or thrice excellent; yea, he ſhews himſelf a Prophet in his Epiſtles, and that in theſe words of the Text, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he foretels the Epidemical diſeaſe of the latter times, and withal preſcribes and applies the remedy.</p>

One that hath made an invaſion and inroad into the heart of the Kingdom, and ſubdued a great part of it; who are here indigitated and pointed out by Saint <hi>John,</hi> and branded with the title of <hi>falſe Prophets: For falſe Prophets are gone out into the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall likewiſe furniſh you with ſundry weapons out of Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Armory, for the better encounter with this enemy.

                  <p>Weapons offenſive; <hi>Try the ſpirits whether they be of God.</hi> And leſt that my diſcovery ſeem unpleaſant, or prove unwelcom unto any of you, I ſhall borrow and take up Saint <hi>John's</hi> Preface for my juſt Apology: <hi>(Dearly Beloved)</hi> and apply it to every one here preſent.

                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with the compellation; <hi>Dearly beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There were two great Apoſtles of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,<note place="margin">The firſt parr. The compella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>John.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was a man of an <hi>hot temper,</hi> and a fiery metal, the freeſt and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his order; one that was ready to vent and put forth himſelf at every turn, and to ply Chriſt with replies and anſwers upon each occaſion: who like unto the <hi>foreman of a Jury,</hi> was commonly the mouth of all the reſt. To ſay with <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that Chriſt loved Saint <hi>Peter</hi> above the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>in ordine ad Eccleſiam;</hi> ſavours ſtrong and ſoure of the <hi>Leaven of the Phariſees,</hi> the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Chriſt loved his Diſciples alike, with an even and uniform love in reference to his Church, yet did Chriſt advance Saint <hi>John</hi> above the reſt of his brethren <hi>in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ad perſonam,</hi> in reference unto his perſon, (as the ſame <hi>Aquinas</hi> affirmeth) as being the natural and neer kinſman of Chriſt, and in that reſpect, the more affected and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him.</p>
                  <p>And as Saint <hi>John</hi> was the beloved, ſo the moſt loving Diſciple of his Lord and Maſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magnes amoris amor,</hi> the love of Chriſt to him, was as an attractive Loadſtone of his heart to the love of Chriſt; and to draw Chriſtians to the mutual love of one another. His ſoul was a full volume of charity, and every leaf of this volume, each leaf in his Epiſtles, each Chapter, and well near verſe and line in thoſe Chapters, contain ſundry invitations and inducements unto charity. And as it was ſaid
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49040:29"/>of <hi>Homers Iliads,</hi>
                     <note n="(a)" place="margin">Juſtin. Martyr. Orat. ad Graecos.</note>

                     </gap>, That, it was carnal and ſenſual love that was the beginning and end of his writings; ſo may it be much more truly affirmed of Saint <hi>Johns</hi> works, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Divine and ſpiritual love, that was the beginning and end, yea, and the middle too of his Epiſtles. This was his conſtant practice in his decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning time, and extremity of old age, that being carried into the Temple upon the ſhoulders of his Diſciples, and being unable to preach to them, in regard of his weakneſs, and infirmity, he would then inculcate and preſs upon them this ſhort and pithy exhortation, which was in effect a very powerful and perſwaſive Sermon; <hi>Filioli diligite voſmet invicom,</hi> little children, love one another; For as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle of faith, <hi>constantiſſimus gratiae praedicator</hi> (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſtiles him) a moſt conſtant Preacher of the free grace of God in Chriſt. As Saint <hi>James</hi> was an Apoſtle of works, which he vehemently urges againſt looſe Libertines and carnal Goſpellers. So this was the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial excellency of S. <hi>John,</hi> that he was an Apoſtle of love, which he expreſſes and evidences in the Compellation here in the Text,<note place="margin">A double du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</note> 
                     <hi>Dearly beloved.</hi> And implies and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates a double duty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">The one of the paſtor.</note> The duty of the Paſtor to love his people, to love them affectionately, tenderly, from the <hi>very heart-root, and bowels yea, in the bowels of Chriſt. For God is my record how I long after you all in the bowels of Jeſus Christ.</hi> It is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> profeſſion to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Phil. 1.8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">The other of the people.</note> The duty of people to be throughly aſſured &amp; perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the love of their Paſtor, and to embrace his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, admonitions, and his ſevereſt reprehenſions, as ſo many <hi>love-tokens</hi> and arguments of his affection. And if the peoples hearts be once poſſeſſed and taken up with this belief, it will be as an Harbinger to make way for the entertainment of their doctrine; it will welcome their Meſſage and their Miniſtry, and make their ſharpeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs not onely ſaving but ſweet; and cauſe them to pray in the words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.5. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me for that is a benefit: and let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49040:29"/>me, and it ſhall be a precious oyl that ſhall not break my head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And let this ſuffice to have ſpoken of the compellation, <hi>Dearly beloved;</hi> For I muſt not ſtay in the porch or entry, which though it be both uſeful and neceſſary in a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet it is onely to lead us into the inward rooms, whereunto I now come.</p>

And therefore that School diſtinction of <hi>Gratia ſufficiens &amp; Efficax,</hi> ſeems not every way accurate enough. The ſeveral members whereof (which in a juſt diviſion ſhould be oppoſite) are coincident with each other; and that grace which is of it ſelf ſufficient, muſt needs be of force and efficacy. For as it is a part of the ſufficiency of God, that he is entire and every way abſolute in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and altogether independent in his Actions upon the creature; ſo it cannot but be eſſential to ſufficient grace, not to borrow of any other, &amp; to want nothing for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the effect: I deny not, but that there may be a ſufficiency in nature, which is not ever attended &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with force and efficacy. Thus a ſoveraign plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter may be ſufficient to cure a putrid &amp; rotten ſore. And a medicinal Potion may be ſufficient to recover a deſperate diſeaſe.

                     <note place="margin">In the Practical uſe and exerciſe.</note> The reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hearing of the Word; the devout adminiſtration of the bleſſed Sacraments; And above all, affectionate &amp; fervent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

                     </gap>, whereunto his houſe is aſſigned and dedicated in a ſpecial manner. <hi>My houſe ſhall be called the Houſe of Prayer for all people,</hi> Iſa. 56.7.

As being a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary action, which by an elegant Synecdoche, compriſeth all other religious duties, that are ordered to it, and derive and borrow from it a plentiful increaſe. Thus is the Temple, the Church of God in the general, and each private Chriſtian in particular, the houſe of Prayer: who prays not onely openly in the outward Temple, but ſecretly in the<note n="(r)" place="margin">Vis in Temple orare de ſcendi in reipſum.

It is ſo with all others, whoſe invocation and calling upon the name of God, immediatly follows God's vocation &amp; effectual calling of them. This is the threefold holineſs of the Temple. The ſeparation. The conſecration. The practical uſe and exerciſe; Theſe are the ſeveral limbs and members of the point, like unto thoſe dry
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49040:78"/>bones in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> viſion, which though they are knit together by their ſeveral Sinewes, yet are they not covered with fleſh and skin, as otherwiſe they might, if the time would permit. And leaſt theſe dry bones ſhould be utterly void of life, give me leave but once more to propheſie unto them, and breath a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the ſpirit of Application.</p>
                  <p>And is the Temple of God holy?<note place="margin">The Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</note> away then with the vainglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vaunt of <hi>Corah</hi> and his complices: <hi>All the congregation of the Lord is holy</hi> every one of them, and the Lord is <hi>among them, Numb.</hi> 16.2. Theſe indeed are the preſumptuous ſpeeches of the ſons of <hi>Corah</hi> (I mean) ſome of our own Tribe: there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt Elect and Reprobate.
<q>Tros, Tyriuſque, illis nullo diſcrimine habentur.</q> There is no certainty of grace, no aſſurance of ſalvation. <hi>Nemo ante obitum foelix,</hi> Beleeve them who liſt, <hi>As is the good, ſo is the ſinner.</hi> And yet ſaith the text expreſly, <hi>The Temple of God is holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But who is this holy Temple? <hi>Quod vos eſtis;</hi> ſo it follows in the Text, ye of the Clergy in a peculiar manner who ſerve at Gods Altar, <hi>Be ye clean that carrie the veſſel of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 52.11. Ye are not only the Temple, but the Prieſts of the Temple, and ſhould have ingraven, as it were, upon your foreheads with the High Prieſt under the Law, <hi>Holineſs unto the Lord. And as he that hath called you, and that not only</hi> ad ſalutem, <hi>but</hi> officium; <hi>as he is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Temple of God is holy; quod vos eſtis;</hi> Ye of the Laity, ye are the Temple and houſe of God: and <hi>holineſs becomes thy houſe for ever: ye are Saints by calling,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. Be not ſo by calling only, <hi>your bodies are the Temples of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. Defile not theſe Temples with uncleanneſs or drunkenneſs; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carouſe nor quaff in theſe veſſels of your bodies, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> ſometimes did in the conſecrated veſſels of the Temple.

The Altar of burnt offering, for the mortifying and ſacrificing of it, kindled with the heavenly fire of fervent zeal, and devout love The Altar of incenſe for the ſending up, and breathing forth the ſweet perfume of your dayly Prayers with the candle of faith, always burning and giving light in the Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>That ſo the holy Spirit of God may be pleaſed to dwell in us, as in his Temple upon earth, and we hereafter dwell with him in the new <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> where there is no Temple, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22. <hi>But the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, are the Temple of it. To which Lord God Almighty be Glory and Honour, Adoration and Thankſgiving, now and for ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

My Text happily doth not a little ſtartle and awaken at the firſt rehearſal and bare ſound of the words, and may ſeem to carry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke in the forehead; then which what more requiſite in the Speaker? what more behoveful for the Hearers? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in theſe ill affected times, that are leſs impatient of their Malady, then of their Remedy. And yet conceive not out of foreſtalled prejudice, that I intend to imitate
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49040:97"/>the <hi>Waſp</hi> or <hi>Hornet,</hi> whoſe property it is to ſting; or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to play the buſie <hi>Fly,</hi> lighting only upon parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerate, the ſores and ulcers of the Commonwealth. How eaſie it is (I am not ignorant) to come within compaſs of an errour, oft-times the greater, and that in a juſt, but intemperate reproof: whereof <hi>Luther</hi> was not free in the judgement of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi>
                     <note n="(b)" place="margin">Mu'ta quidem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare monet ſed utinam ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilius admonu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſet. Erajm. Epiſt. lib. <hi>12.</hi> ad Rect. Acad. Erſurt.</note> 
                     <hi>That his admonitions were no leſs excellent then neceſſary; but it had been well if he bad ſeaſoned them with more civility.</hi> Herein he did amiſs, and reſpect muſt be had to the Poets rule, <hi>Quid verum quidque decet;</hi> which was warily obſerved by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> as a notable pattern and example, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.25. <hi>I ſpeak the words of truth and ſoberneſs.</hi> And this will we do if God permit.</p>
                  <p>The Method of the Propheſie is like the manner of Gods appearing to <hi>Eliah</hi> upon mount <hi>Horeb:</hi> firſt in a boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and bluſtering wind, and then in a ſoft and ſtill voice. He begins by way of aſtoniſhment, with a vehement reprehenſion of the unheard of abominations of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the more monſtrous becauſe theirs; And ſolemnly denounceth his ſierce wrath againſt the heads of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters: and theſe were the head, the prime and chief among them. <hi>Thy Princes are rebellious and companions of theeves,</hi> verſ. 23. yea, head and taile were both alike: <hi>Every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards.</hi> All ſorts of men had corrupted their wayes, and it was then verified of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which <hi>Salvian</hi> afterwards applied to the City of<note n="(c)" place="margin">Plena tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis &amp; turpitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinibus. t Salv. de Carthag.</note> 
                     <hi>Carthage,</hi> that it was as full of ſin as of people. Thus is the firſt part ſpent in ſharp menaces and terms of objurgation; God deſcends in the ſequel, in a calm and gentle ſtrain from matter of terrour to the means of their recovery. My Text borders betwixt both, and partakes jointly of a promiſe and threatning. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe it is, if we reſpect the general good thence accruing to the Nation; but a ſevere threatning of the perſons in particular.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>God deſcends from the Iudges to the Counſellors, and my ſpeech muſt deſcend likewiſe with the order of the words. Betwixt theſe two there is a neer conjunction, and are here linked in the ſame cenſure, after the manner of Malefactors, and ſeldom do they tranſgreſs alone. They may not unfitly be aſſimilated to the Liver and the Heart in the body natural; the Liver firſt concocts the meat, and converts the nouriſhment into blood, ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to the Heart, which animates it by the inward heat, and changes it into vital ſpirits. Thus the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor as the Liver prepares the matter for the Judge, who like the Heart by his proper power, doth umpire and determine it. And as the Liver ſometimes corrupts the Heart by conveighing crude and indigeſted humours, and the Heart impoyſons the Liver with peſtilential va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and diſtempers; So oft the Counſellor perverts the ſentence of the Judge by miſ-information, and the Iudge croſſes the ſuggeſtions of the Counſellor by a ſiniſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>What were the particular faults of <hi>Judahs</hi> Counſellors is not punctually ſet down in the Context; nor will I be over curious in the inquiry, but only probably conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, in touching thoſe that are neareſt allied with their profeſſion, and moſt ordinary in practice.</p>
                  <p>Some there are that have vented both their ſpleen and ſolly, in ſpeaking contumeliouſly of their calling: Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his compariſon of the Field, the Fowl, and the Net
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49040:109"/>is well known; and who were the Fowlers, but Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates and Atturneys. Let me not be thought bold, though I tax his Holineſs. Not to mention the reſolution of the queſtion by the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> touching the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the Lawyer and Phyſician, it being ſcurrious and invective. That common Proverb is as uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as witty; The Phyſitian ſeldome lives well, and the Lawyer dies well; The former being oft intemperate in their Diet: the latter injurious in their Courſes. For mine own part, I cannot but think as reverently of the Counſellours profeſſion as of the name; ſo honourable in it ſelf that it is attributed by way of excellency to our bleſſed Saviour; <hi>And he ſhall call his Name Counſellour, Iſa.</hi> 9.6. yet is this no priviledge of exemption or <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeas</hi> to the profeſſours why they may not prove guilty of miſcarriage, or lay open to reproof, Why elſe ſhould they ſtand in need of God's reſtoring?</p>
                  <p>As he ſpake in praiſe of <hi>Tully;</hi> He that would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>Cicero,</hi> muſt be another <hi>Cicero,</hi> for the ſtrength and ſinnews of his Oratory; So it were a task more meet for a Lawyer then a Divine to acquaint you with the tith of their abuſes: I ſhould weary your patience, and mine own infirmity, (as they many of their Clients,) to inſiſt upon their lingring and tedious delays, Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of practice, Labyrinths of ſuits and controverſies, croſs motions, as fitly ſo ſtiled, as Grammarians derive <hi>montes à movendo: motion without motion:</hi> Contentions ſpringing up like <hi>Hydra</hi>'s Heads, following faſt and thick, as one wave upon the neck of another, and as one circle begets many.

                  <p>IT is the Divine Aphoriſme of the great Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 15.4.<note place="margin">The Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> 
                     <hi>Whatſoever things were written afore time, were written for our learning.</hi> And this <hi>whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> is a very large and comprehenſive word, and relates
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49040:115"/>not only to dogmatical and doctrinal truths, but to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical examples, to matters of Fact as well as Faith: all which are recorded and ſiled up in Holy Writ, and ſerve as patterns for our imitation or inſtruction, to make us the more cautinate and wary in the ſteering of our courſe from the ſhipwrack of others, that we ſplit not our ſelves upon thoſe rocks, nor be ſwallowed up of thoſe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, wherein they have periſhed. <hi>This is the uſe we are to make of examples, that we our ſelves be not made exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and we are diligently to obſerve and peruſe Hiſtory, that we become not a Story to poſterity.</hi> The Text is part of a <hi>Story,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory</hi> is a relation of things paſt, the ſayings and doings of our Anceſtors. And if we look back a little to the beginning of the Chapter, we may from thence take the riſe of theſe words, and retrive the occaſion of the Hiſtory: there we find mention of <hi>Corahs</hi> rebellion, as the ring-leader and chief actor in it; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and two hundred and fifty men as his complices and confederates in his conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. All theſe combined and headed together in an open affront offered to the publick authority of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Prince and Prieſt of the people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe they charged and challenged in an high ſtrain of inſolent intruſion into that place and office, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they were not deſigned of God; and for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering &amp; lording it over their brethren. <hi>And they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered themſelvs together againſt Moſes &amp; Aaron and ſaid unto them, Ye take too much upon you, ſeeing all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is amongſt them; wherefore then lift ye up your ſelves above the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Lord?</hi> Num. 16.3. Nor was it enough for them to word it by way of conteſtation, and to beard them to their face, unleſs they commented upon their mutinous ſpeeches, by the like preſumptuous attempts and undertakings; For <hi>the two hundred and fifty men took every man his cenſer, and put fire in them, and laid incenſe thereon,</hi> verſe 18. which of right belonged to the Prieſt; whereas <hi>Corah</hi> and his crue were but the ſons of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49040:115"/>
                     <hi>Levi</hi> at the beſt, and <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Reuben;</hi> neither of which had any authority at all to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with the Prieſt-hood. And albeit they agreed and joined together in the ſame common ſin, yet were they differenced and diſtinguiſhed in the puniſhment. As for <hi>Corah</hi> and his rebellious rout, they were removed and ſwept away with a ſtrange and unheard of miracle; <hi>The earth cleving aſunder</hi> under the unſupportable weight of ſo unprofitable a burden, opening her devouring jaws to ſwallow them up, <hi>who went down quick into the pit,</hi> verſe 31, 32, 33. But as for the two hundred and fifty that offered incenſe, they did thereby incenſe the fierce wrath of God, and it fared with them as with <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, who offered ſtrange fire,</hi> and <hi>periſhed by fire in as ſtrange a manner. And there came out a fire from the Lord, and conſumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incenſe,</hi> verſe 35. And leſt that ſo <hi>ſignal</hi> and <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary</hi> a <hi>puniſhment</hi> ſhould be buried in oblivion with the ſufferers, God takes a ſpecial care and order that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory thereof ſhould be commended &amp; tranſmitted to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity: And whereas the <hi>puniſhment ſeized but upon few, the example ſhould reach unto all;</hi> and this is the reaſon of the ſtrict command and charge of God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Eleazer</hi> the ſon of <hi>Aaron</hi> the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> in the words of the Text, <hi>The cenſers of theſe ſinners, &amp;c.</hi>

Even as the cunning Archer directs the ſight of his eye to the white or mark, but glances in the ſecond place at the Butt; Thus may a Chriſtian have ſalvation in his eye as the Butt whereat he ſhoots, though he punctually aims and levels at God as the white: Neither can we faſten our arrows in the Butt, and participate of ſalvation, but we muſt needs hit the white, and enjoy the beatifical vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and preſence of God himſelf.</p>
